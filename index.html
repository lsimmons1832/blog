	<h1>An Ugly Betty Blog</h1>
		<article>I love my beauty. It's not my fault. Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. I think God is the most fantastic designer. My aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor. Insecurity is a waste of time.

	<h1>Fashion Forward Thinking</h1>
		<article>
			The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward. The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward. Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable. I think I'd go mad if I didn't have a place to escape to. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect.

	<h1>Trendy or Trashy</h1>
		<article>
		I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing with them over the years, but always staying on the same track. An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. It is important to be chic. It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same.

	<h1>To Blush or Not to Blush</h1>
		<article>
		There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company. Fashion fosters cliches of beauty, but I want to tear them apart. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous. Money is the most corrosive aspect of life today because it means that all attention to detail is forgotten.</article>
	<h1>Fussy Hair - Don't Dare!</h1>
		<article>
		Brides today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. You can only go forward by making mistakes. If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better.
