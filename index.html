		<p>I love my beauty. It's not my fault. Vanity is the healthiest thing in life. I think God is the most fantastic designer. My aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor. Insecurity is a waste of time.</p> <p>Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul. I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today. I would like the people that buy my clothes to understand that for me it's one small piece of art. If you cut a painter's hands off, he'd still feel the urge to pick up a brush. All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox.</p><br>

			<h2 class="header2">Fashion Forward Thinking</h2>
				<article id="article2">
			<p>The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward. The great thing about fashion is that it always looks forward. Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable. I think I'd go mad if I didn't have a place to escape to. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. You can't just buy things for the label - it's ridiculous. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. Fashion fades, only style remains the same. For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk.</p>

			<p>I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing. I don't really know how to do casual clothes. For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive. Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose your fabrics depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you realize what you want it to be. When I was young, I lived like an old woman, and when I got old, I had to live like a young person.</p><br>

				<h2 class="header3">Trendy or Trashy</h2>
					<article id="article3">
		I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing with them over the years, but always staying on the same track. An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. It is important to be chic. It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. <br>

			<h2 class="header4">To Blush or Not to Blush</h2>
				<article id="article4">
		<p>There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company. Fashion fosters cliches of beauty, but I want to tear them apart. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous. Money is the most corrosive aspect of life today because it means that all attention to detail is forgotten.</p> <p>What I hate is nasty, ugly people. Jeans represent democracy in fashion. Being one step ahead of a fashion trend is not so important to me. What matters is to always forge ahead. It's useless to send models out on the runway to cry. You can only go forward by making mistakes.</p><br>

			<h2 class="header5">Fussy Hair - Don't Dare!</h2>
				<article id="article5">
		Brides today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose integrity. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. You can only go forward by making mistakes. If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better.<br>
